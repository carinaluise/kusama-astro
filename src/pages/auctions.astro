      The key to Kusama’s scalable multichain architecture, parachains
      connect to the network by leasing a slot on the Relay Chain via
      permissionless auction. As Polkadot’s canary network, Kusama is
      rolling out parachain auctions first for testing and optimization.

      <p>
        Parachain slot auctions follow a modified candle auction format,
        with each auction lasting approximately 1 week. To prevent
        auction sniping (the strategy of bidding at the last moment) and
        promote more accurate price discovery, the exact endpoint of a
        particular auction remains unknown until after the auction’s
        close.

        Each auction has an open bidding period of approximately 1 week
        and assigns a total slot duration of 48 weeks (divided into 8
        lease periods of 6 weeks each). The auction timetable is
        determined by the Kusama Council.

        Each auction has an ending period that begins approximately 1
        day and 21 hours after the start of the auction and lasts until
        the end of the 1-week bidding period. The auction’s end point
        can be any time within the ending period, and is automatically
        and randomly chosen by the VRF at the close of the 1-week
        bidding period.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Some teams may choose to crowdfund their slot lease using
        Kusama’s built-in crowdloan mechanism, which allows people to
        contribute by agreeing to lock up their own KSM until the end of
        the lease. Teams can reward their contributors however they see
        fit, and can structure their crowdloan in various ways, hosting
        it either natively on Kusama or on a 3rd-party platform.
