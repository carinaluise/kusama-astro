      Parachains are Kusama’s advanced, next-generation blockchains
      that bring several breakthroughs compared to legacy networks.
      Together they form the Kusama ecosystem, an interconnected
      network of specialized chains breaking down the walls of the
      centralized web. Open possibilities for Web3 builders.

    <h2 class="mb-8">Open possibilities for Web3 builders.</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6">
      While other blockchain networks only allow developers to build
      dapps using smart contracts, Kusama gives them full control over
      the underlying blockchain itself. This flexibility gives
      parachain developers the maximum freedom to optimize for
      specific use cases — which means better and more secure dapps
      and services for all.

        Parachains can act autonomously based on the will of their
        communities to participate in Kusama governance and allocate
        on-chain treasuries. This opens the door to new decentralized
        funding models, from project funding to decentralized
        sovereign wealth funds and even cross-chain mergers and
        acquisitions.

        Three limited edition NFTs were created to celebrate the
        launch of Kusama parachains. Representing three
        interpretations of the Kusama canary by Berlin street artists
        Awer, Vidam and Andreas Preis, the paintings were created on a
        section of the Berlin wall now used as an open canvas for free
        artistic expression. The collection was limited to 9,999 NFTs,
        which have already been claimed.
